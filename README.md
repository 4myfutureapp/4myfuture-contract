For compile the code just run the following script: 
`sh scripts/build.sh`
It will generate the .wasm file and will deploy it on testnet 


Exploring The Code ðŸ˜Ž
==================

The main smart contract code lives in `src` folder.
Here you will find five .rs files:

1. Enumeration --> Here you will find all the contract query methods
2. Internal --> File created for manage internal complex methods that are called for the main methods
